##  **Featured Projects**

###  Scalable Azure ELT Pipeline
*Designed and documented a cloud-based ELT pipeline on **Azure (Data Factory, Databricks)** automating ingestion from 10+ heterogeneous sources.*  
**Impact**: Reduced manual reporting workload by **15+ hours/week** with automated quality checks and alerting.  
**Key Challenge**: Handling schema evolution and partial failures gracefully across diverse source systems.

### ❄️ Snowflake Data Platform Modernization
*Migrated legacy ETL processes to a **Snowflake + dbt Cloud** stack with incremental modeling.*  
**Impact**: Improved data freshness from daily to near-real-time while cutting compute costs by **~20%**.  
**Key Challenge**: Rewriting complex business logic with idempotent, incremental dbt models.

###  High-Performance Data Tooling (Rust)
*Exploring **Rust** for building memory-safe, high-throughput data processing utilities.*  
**Current Focus**: CLI tools for data validation and pipeline health checks with native performance.
